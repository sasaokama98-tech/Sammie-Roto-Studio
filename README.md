Sammie Roto Studio is the VFX-focused extension of [Sammie-Roto 2](https://github.com/Zarxrax/Sammie-Roto-2), adding SAM 3.1 tracking and high-quality trimap/matting workflows while retaining the original application's interaction and export pipeline.

Sammie-Roto 2 is an easy-to-use, cross-platform desktop application for AI assisted masking of video clips. It has 3 primary functions:
- Video Segmentation using [SAM2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2)
- Video Matting using [MatAnyone](https://github.com/pq-yang/MatAnyone), [MatAnyone 2](https://github.com/pq-yang/MatAnyone2), and [VideoMaMa](https://github.com/cvlab-kaist/VideoMaMa)
- Video Object Removal using [MiniMax-Remover](https://github.com/zibojia/MiniMax-Remover)

Sammie-Roto 2 is free and open source, but runs models produced by several external projects and organizations. Some models may have restrictions on commercial usage. Please check with the relevant model provider if you have questions regarding licensing.
